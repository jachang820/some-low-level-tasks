Files included:
README		- This file, a brief description, and questions answered.

Makefile	- Make options:
		  (default)
		  build     : Builds executable for lab4b.
		  
		  check     : Smoke-test to see whether sensors work.

		  dist      : Create distribution file in .tgz gzip tar.

		  clean	    : Deletes all output created by the Makefile.

lab4b.c         - Source file for program that samples temperature using the
		  Intel Edison IoT board and the Grove Shield and temperature
		  sensor. 
		  Usage: ./lab4b --period=# --scale=F|C --log=filename
		  period    : sampling period in number of seconds
		  	      (precision to milliseconds)
		  scale	    : Fahrenheit or Celsius
		  log	    : log temperature samples and commands to logfile

EdisonSensors.h	- Header for EdisonSensors.

EdisonSensors.c - Contains all related functions for AIO and GPIO setting and
		  retrieval with the MRAA library.

PreciseTimer.h  - Header for PreciseTimer.

PreciseTimer.c  - PreciseTimer implementation to provide convenient functions
		  for sampling.

Lots of Linux mans!

Explains how to use valgrind to find memory leaks and debug program logic.
I used sudo apt-get install valgrind instead of downloading the tar.

stackoverflow.com/questions/24801260/how-to-prevent-echoing-of-escape-characters-in-c
Convinced me that I had to use non-echo non-canonical mode to achieve the UI
that I want; namely, to maintain the input line despite stdout of the report each
sampling period. Also, it seems impossible to remove special characters such as DEL,
which shows up as ^?, using non-canonical mode.

pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap11.html#tag_11_01_09
Gives detailed information of all the terminal options. I spent some time messing
around with them to get the stdin and stdout behavior I wanted.

stackoverflow.com/questions/11127970/is-it-possible-to-write-data-into-own-stdin
Confirmed it is impossible to write back into stdin programmatically without
either:
1. ungetc() can push single characters back in, but not before it echoes.
2. Redirection. I didn't want to change these settings back and forth if I could
avoid it. It ended up being unnecessary.

stackoverflow.com/questions/1508490/erase-the-current-printed-console-line
Explains how to erase current line on the console. I used it to clear the line
when the sampling report interrupts the input. Instead of having the line cut off
and output before the report, I wanted the report on its own line. I used non-
canonical output to read and save the input, and this technique to remove the
line in the console, and wrote the input back in after the report to preserve
incomplete inputs.

Explains how setting time zones work behind the scenes and how to set it for the
Edison. It was educational.
