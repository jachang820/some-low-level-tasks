# Series of Projects Revolving Around Low Level Systems

These are a series of weekly projects regarding one of the best courses of a certain CS curriculum. Note that each part (in the subfolders) contain readmes including inputs, dependencies and sources. 

## Topics

The topic of each part are as follows:

0. The warmup project allows the user to induce segfaults, which the program will catch.
1. These are client and server programs that allow client to write into the terminal, and server to repeat the message back.
2. These test the reliability of mutex or spinlock on critical sections of list operations, like sorting a list.
3. These attempt to analyze a simplistic file system.
4. These set up an IoT server on the Intel Edison platform that monitors temperature.
